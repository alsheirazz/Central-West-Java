**Overview of the different options for discontinuing a Alsheiraz open source project, this process is to
be used for projects which no longer have active maintainers, or projects which Alsheiraz no longer have a motivation
to maintain, usually due to lack of internal use.**


### Summary

I decided to discontinue the development of this project to concentrate my efforts on other projects.

- Im obligated to gracefully discontinue projects, which i have no motivation to maintain anymore
- Projects can be archived, users directed to a 3rd party fork, but the ownership of such project cant be transferred
- The open source guild can help you make the right choice


**Contact the open-source guild (Alsheiraz or Beckzy) for guidance.**
