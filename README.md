### Summary

- Im obligated to gracefully discontinue projects, which i have no motivation to maintain anymore
- Projects can be archived, users directed to a 3rd party fork, but the ownership of such project cant be transferred
- The open source guild can help you make the right choice


**Contact the open-source guild for guidance.**
